<h1>Background</h1>
<p> It is well known that tobacco and alcohol can have adverse effects on human health. 
	It is also well known that 90% of people with oral cancer used tobacco products, and 75-80% of those patients also drank alcohol. 
	According to the CDC, the survival rate is approximately 50%. 
	</p>

<h1>About Pharynx Analysis (R)</h1>
<p>The purpose of the study done in R is to assess what variables affect the survival rate of carcinoma of the oropharynx. 
Oral cancer is hard to discover or diagnose, meaning that late stage discovery is more common. 
Due to late stage discovery, this cancer has often metastasized to another location thus reducing the time duration until death. 
A survival analysis on oral cancer helps to answer what characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival, what the proportion of the population that will survive past a given time, and what will be the rate at which those who survive, die, or fail.</p>

<h2>Methods (R)</h2>
<p>The data was analayzed using Cox Proportional Hazards model due to its advantage of fitting survival models without specifying the underlying hazard function. 
This is helpful, because we donâ€™t necessarily always know what the underlying hazard function is. 
The predictors used to look at were condition (COND), tumor stage (T_STAGE), and node stage (N_STAGE). 
When running a Cox Proportional Hazards model, node stage violated the proportional hazards assumption. 
Aftwewrads an initial regression model where time (TIME) was my independent variable and condition and tumor stage as my dependent variables was created in order to look at an outlier test. 
One observation highly influenced the model and decided to remove that outlier. 
Once removing that outlier another Cox Proportional Hazards Model was fitted, however node stage was still an insignificant predictor. 
Other predictors as well as interactions were introduced, but it appears that tumor stage and condition were the only significant predictors. </p>

<h1>About Pharynx Analysis (SAS)</h1>
<p>The purpose of the study was to predict patient outcome of those diagnosed with carcinoma of the oropharynx. 
	<br>The hypothesis: treatment type will have a significant effect on survival. </p>

<h2>Methods (SAS)</h2>
    <p>Collected data included January 1968 and continued until December 1972. 
	To be included in the study, I looked at patient eligibility criteria, and screened for extreme cases. 
	The study consists of 195 patients diagnosed with oral cancer in varying stages of the cancer.
	The data was collected at 6 large cancer research institutions across the United States. 
	The patients were randomly assigned to either the standard treatment, radiation therapy, or the test treatment, radiation coupled with chemotherapy. 
	Approximately 27% of participants were censored due to the patient moving or transferring to another institution that did not participate in the study.
    The data was analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazards model as the data suggested. 
	To build the model, a backward selection method to analyze the most relevant variables. 
	Condition, tumor stage and node stage were the most relevant whereas node stage violates the proportional hazard assumption. 
	After additional analysis, an observation that heavily influenced the model was found. 
	The observation was removed, as it may have been entered wrong, because the values did not make sense intuitively.
	<br>Analysis was completed using SAS 9.4.  </p>
